# Random-Forest-Classifier
 It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
 Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
 The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.
